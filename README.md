You can build this project on a PC or directly on your Android device.

### 🖥️ 1. Build on PC (Windows / macOS / Linux)

| OS | Requirements | Steps to Build |
|---|---|---|
| **Windows** | Android Studio, Git, JDK 17+ | `git clone https://github.com/Deepanjan008/Calculator.git` <br> `cd Calculator` <br> Open in Android Studio > Sync Gradle > Press Shift+F10 to Run. |
| **macOS** | Android Studio, Git, JDK 17+ | `git clone https://github.com/Deepanjan008/Calculator.git` <br> `cd Calculator` <br> Open in Android Studio > Sync Gradle > Press Control+R to Run. |
| **Linux** | Android Studio, Git, JDK 17+ | `git clone https://github.com/Deepanjan008/Calculator.git` <br> `cd Calculator` <br> Open in Android Studio > Sync Gradle > Press Shift+F10 to Run. |

### 📱 2. Build on Android (via Termux)

You can compile the app entirely on your phone without needing Android Studio.

**Step 1: Install Dependencies**
```bash
pkg update && pkg upgrade
pkg install git openjdk-17

```
**Step 2: Clone the Repository & Enter Folder**
```bash
cd Calculator
git clone https://github.com/Deepanjan008/Calculator.git
```
**Step 3: Setup Android SDK**
*(Ensure Android command-line tools are downloaded and $ANDROID_HOME is properly configured in your Termux environment).*
**Step 4: Build the APK**
```bash
chmod +x gradlew
./gradlew assembleDebug

```
*Once the build is successful, find the generated APK inside app/build/outputs/apk/debug/ and install it.*
## ⚠️ Important Note for Release Build
If you attempt to generate a release build using ./gradlew assembleRelease, the build will **fail**.
This project uses secure environment variables for signing the release APK. The Keystore file (nexura_release.jks) and the following variables are strictly excluded from this repository for security reasons:
 * NEO_STORE_PASSWORD
 * NEO_KEY_ALIAS
 * NEO_KEY_PASSWORD
### 🔑 How to Generate Your Own Keystore for Release
If you want to build a release APK, you must generate your own Keystore file. Run the following command in your terminal (inside the app directory):
```bash
keytool -genkey -v -keystore your_own_release.jks -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000 -alias your_alias_name

```
During generation, you will be prompted to enter the following details:
 * **Enter keystore password:** Type a strong password (e.g., MySecurePass123). *Note: It won't show on the screen as you type.*
 * **Re-enter new password:** Type the same password again.
 * **What is your first and last name?** Enter your name or developer name.
 * **What is the name of your organizational unit?** E.g., Development.
 * **What is the name of your organization?** E.g., Nexura Labs.
 * **What is the name of your City or Locality?** E.g., Kolkata.
 * **What is the name of your State or Province?** E.g., West Bengal.
 * **What is the two-letter country code for this unit?** E.g., IN (for India).
 * **Is CN=..., OU=..., O=..., L=..., ST=..., C=IN correct?** Type yes and press Enter.
**Update app/build.gradle.kts:**
After generating your_own_release.jks, replace the signingConfigs in app/build.gradle.kts with your new keystore details, or set the environment variables locally on your machine.
